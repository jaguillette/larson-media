# Larson Family Archive

This is a repository that I'm putting together to link up whatever I digitize
from tapes and slides that were in my grandmother's basement, so that my family
can see and hear them. Everything's hosted in my AWS S3 bucket.

## To publish

run `make publish` then `make github`
